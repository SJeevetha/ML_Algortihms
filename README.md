Hello guys, This repository contains my implementations on key concepts in Machine Learning, focusing on Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.

ðŸ“– Learning Goals
Understand the theory behind each algorithm.

Implementing each algorithms and models from scratch 

Visualize results for better interpretation.
